Created in Visual Studio for Mac by Spencer Sliffe.

I created this website as a joke my sophomore year fall of 2021. 

The prototype runs without errors. 

I have not looked at this project since about November of 2021 however I plan to come back to it.


The websites home page displays 2 pictures in which the user can choose from. 

The User chooses the frame in which they feel has the hotter picture.

The picture that is chosen is rewarded points and 2 new pictures are displayed and so on and so forth and what have you....

The top 3 are displayed with their picture and score on a leaderboard page.
